I've had guests from all corners of the globe, and its amazing to hear all of their unique stories.  I'm happy to give restaurant, or neighborhood recommendations, and even on occasion taking my guests out on a little tour.  I want my guests to have the best possible time during their visit to San Diego.

Parking is free and easy- you never have to 'hunt' for a spot. Neighborhood is quiet and diverse- a lot of Vietnamese and Mexican families here. Less crime here than in La Jolla, according to SDPD website. We often walk at night, and have never been disturbed or harassed while doing so. Our neighborhood is perched on the edge of Tecolote Canyon, the mouth of which is right at Mission Bay; as a result, the prevailing westerly breeze comes off the ocean, across Mission Bay, into Tecolote Canyon and filters thru the neighborhood, which is why most houses here do not have A/C.","If you're looking to walk to bars, restaurants, and nightlife, this may not be the spot for you; however, if you want a clean, quiet, affordable space with easy parking and don't mind short drives to attractions, this is the best.","Close to all SD attractions without the big price tag and attendant hassles (noise/congestion/parking issues).

I am born and raised in Germany but have lived over half my life in the US and am absolutely in love with San Diego. I got my Bachelors from San Diego State University in Hospitality and Tourism Management and have lived here for 10 years now. I would love to share my Insider tips with you and tell you about the best beach spots and places to explore and where to dine. 

This is my father's house and as he has the extra space and travels often, I am excited to invite others to have a chance to enjoy this home and neighborhood as much as we do. 

When my father travels for business, I rent out the space for him. I currently live in the room downstairs and you will have the upstairs area to yourself.

The name "University" (both for the neighborhood and nearby University Avenue) comes from a plan in the 1880s to build a university in the area. It came to be the State Normal School, which evolved into what is now San Diego State University. That's why the word "university" is prevalent in this part of town, even though there is no university around.  It has some interesting history.

From the roof deck you have expansive views of the bay and the way to downtown. Plenty of street parking in this residential part of PB (called Crown Point). And I provide 1 off street parking spot as well. I love to share my favorite parts of SD and am available via phone or text.

It is centrally located in SD and only a 10-15 min drive/Uber from downtown Gaslamp, Hillcrest, Little Italy, North Park, Ocean Beach, La Jolla and more. I have a lengthy guide of my favorite places that I provide to my guests.","This is my primary residence so I ask that you treat the place as you would your own. I've put in gorgeous beachy hard wood flooring in the bedroom and granite in the bathroom. (This is a 2 bedroom condo but I keep my bedroom locked and don't rent it out; I rent out my place - apart from my bedroom - when I am out of town). Roof deck is accessible by pull down ladder style stairs; a short stairway but steep and requires 2 hands to climb up.","You can walk to many places in PB. Also available are bikes and scooters (Birds) for renting and an Uber ride anywhere in PB is only about 5$. Ubering out of PB approx 15$.",,"I love to share my favorite parts of SD and am available via phone or text.","- Quiet after 10 pm (very quiet neighborhood)",,140349111,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/140349111,Nicole,2017-07-14,"San Diego, California, United States",,"within an hour",0.01,NULL,0,"Pacific Beach",2,2,0,0,"San Diego, CA, United States","Pacific Beach","Mission Bay","San Diego",CA,92109,"San Diego","San Diego, CA",US,"United States",32.7929,-117.23364,t,condominium,"entire home/apt",2,1,1,1,"real bed","{TV,Wifi,Kitchen,"Free parking on premises","Indoor fireplace","Smoke detector","Fire extinguisher",Essentials,"Lock on bedroom door",Hangers,"Self check-in",Lockbox,"Private entrance"}",NULL,250,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,2,1125,1970,4,2018-07-22,2019-05-27,1970,1970,1970,1970,1970,1970,1970,f,0,0,strict_14_with_grace_period,0,0,2019,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

During my time in school I worked as a kitchen expediter at Momofuku Ssam Bar and now I work at a farm-to-table restaurant called Blue Hill. I love the work but I also am interested in cooking,  health and wellness, and teaching fitness to others via Crossfit. 

I have hosted AirBnB guests through my roommate while he has been out of town and I feel I have learned how to be a good guest through being a good host. I am very respectful, clean, and positive person.

I thought finding some great three-word descriptions of San Diego would be a fun, and entertaining way to let you know what people think of in San Diego.

Speaking of driving, I strongly recommend visiting Point Loma, Pacific Beach, La Jolla, Del Mar and the typical places like the world-famous San Diego Zoo and Sea World, Legoland, Balboa Park, and Miramar. Great places to see are anything along the coastline starting from Coronado Island/Downtown San Diego, then going north for the next 45 miles: Rent a convertible, start driving from the Silver Strand Highway in the south part of Coronado Island, and then go across the bridge to Interstate 5 north, then to the Pacific Coast Highway from Downtown San Diego, all the way up to Oceanside.

My name is MJ and although I wasn't born in So Cal, I moved to Mission Beach with my family when I was 13.  I spent the next 10+ years living in the beach communities of both Mission and Pacific Beach, graduated from Mission Bay High and attended SDSU.  It was in my late 20s that I moved to NY, where I finished my Undergraduate degree and earned my Masters.  

Although I enjoyed spending 7 years on the East Coast, home was in San Diego and I made it my mission to return back home without changing employers.  I needed to get back to the beach and I was fortunate in that an opportunity allowed me to move back in 2010.  Starting in 2013, I actively worked with my real estate agent to find the perfect property, which is this gem :).

I purchased the condo in Dec 2015 and have been up and running hosting on Airbnb since March of 2016.  While this is an investment, I'm heavily involved including being a member of the HOA board.   I've done quite a bit of upgrades and living only 1 mile away from the condo proves itself to be invaluable time and time again. 

I take pride in providing a clean, comfortable and affordable place to stay.  I aim to ensure that those are the critical as that's what I look for when on personal or business travel.

While I do have a "day-job", I am fortunate enough to have great family support which allows for response from a secondary live person.

Then its sporadic throughout the day until last takeoff at 11:00pm. The flight path constantly changes so its not always directly overhead. We do provide beach chairs, towels and umbrellas. They will usually be in the closet as well as an elect","Our neighborhood is very ideal in the fact that we are a 10 minute walk to the beach and central Ocean Beach. There is a Farmers Market every Wednesday from 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm. Try a Hodads Burger while on Newport Ave. Also, for delicious Italian fare, I recommend Pepe's Italian restaurant on Sunset Cliffs Blvd. We will make every attempt to leave local guides and maps for you. Also, make sure you drive south on Sunset Cliffs Blvd to watch the sun go down at Sunset Cliffs. There are parking lots along the bluffs to park. At the end of Sunset Cliffs there are walking trails. Also, There is a cafe on the Ocean Beach pier that food while you take a break while walking the longest pier on the west coast.","Kids 15 and under may stay for free. You will also notice that we have a couple of chickens roaming the yard that I let out every morning between 6:30 and 7:00 am. If they are on your porch at any point, just shoo them away. Our doggy's name is Smooch, she's a Beagle Mix, 3yrs old, our Kitties name is Tiare. You will also find out Sulcata Land tortoise in the yard. His name is Ashes. There are Fireworks every night in the summer from Sea World that you will be able to see and hear. Usually starting at 8:53PM. It's closer to 10:00 pm on weekends and holidays.","If your staying local and going to the beach, its best to take the time to walk there. Parking can be tight in the beach area. However when you venture futher south to the Cliffs, you may want to drive. If headed out for a night on the town, I recommend downloading the UBER app and utilizing it.","You will have access and privacy in your own space. There are a couple of chickens in the backyard and we ask that you do not let them out. The yard can be utilized as a common space and I do provide a charcoal BBQ for your use.",,"This studio is on our property and we expect it to be treated as if it were your home.

I manage leased apartments and homes and I broker real estate sales transaction. In addition to managing and brokering properties, I own several of my own and have become somewhat of an expert in remodeling, especially on a budget. As a traveler, I'm pretty easy going. I don't need an overly fancy place, but can appreciate one if that's what I select. My main needs are clean and comfortable. Further, hosts should know that as a property owner myself, I am very respectful of others, their personal property and of course, diversity of living situation.

When I'm not working or traveling, I can often be found enjoying time with friends, my 9.5 year old extremely well-behaved dog named Miss Pickles, or quiet time. I also enjoy visiting Palm Springs where I also have a small home.

While I enjoy going out for drinks at a club on occasion, I tend to prefer more intimate gatherings with friends at one of our homes or a restaurant. Being around quality people interests me far more than the quantity of people. That said, when I'm out, some say I'm the life of a party as I tend to have a pretty good sense of humor.

If you host a place for me, I think you'll find me to be a good guest and one that you would extend an invitation to again. I do not smoke nor do I bring my pet on my trips, unless we've discussed such in advance.  I look forward to meeting you in the future!

Airbnb offers a perfect opportunity for me as I've been in the hospitality industry for many years. Our life in South Park is exciting as we enjoy living in this fun neighborhood and so close to Balboa Park. Rick built our stunning 3 story craftsman guesthouse 12 years ago before he retired as an Architect.  We've raised our 5 kids and are also Grandparents. Our daughter in law Romany is our Co-Host for which we are very thankful and she is a delight to our guests also. Our garden keeps us in shape and we go for bike rides, walks and runs through South Park for daily exercise.  Being in love with California just never gets old for me as I was born and raised in The Netherlands.  We enjoy regular trips to our cabin in the Oregon mountains near Rick's family. It's what we live for I should say.   We are also passionate about food, love to cook and entertain with our family and friends.

I am also a retired professional beach volleyball player, high school varsity coach and club volleyball coach, and an entrepreneur from Monument, Colorado.  During the summers, I used to travel and compete on the professional beach volleyball tour against some of the best players in the country.  Now I try to get outside as much as possible, but I coach more than I play.  Currently, I am the Varsity Indoor and Beach Volleyball coach at University City High School as well as a club coach for La Jolla Volleyball Club.  I have been living in the San Diego area for almost 8 years and remain very active in the community.   
My personality is friendly and outgoing, I love to travel, and make friends with a spontaneous and adventurous spirit.  I am always willing to try something once.  I love all types of animals, enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, I love to workout and push myself to the limits, and I especially enjoy the sunshine and beach.  A few things I can't live without are: My Hydroflask Waterbottle, a volleyball, pillow, friends, and my family.
   
I look forward to hosting my place on AirBnB.  My goal is for others to enjoy sunny San Diego as much as I do.  I am very laid back and my sense of style is bright and playful.  The sunshine and bright colors make me happy, and are reflected in my home design.  I want people to feel like they are on a relaxing vacation and able to get away from reality.  My hope is that my place feels cozy and has the characteristics of a home away from home!  People will want to tell their friends about my place and come back, I know it!!!

Born in the mid-west and raised in southern California, I've grown up appreciating our weather that allows outdoor activities year round such as the beach, volleyball, gardening, music venues, local winter skiing and occasional pubbing with friends.
I'm socially out-going and love to meet people of different cultures and points of view. I believe that travel makes us better and more balanced. My philosophy is: a city is a city; the difference is the people you meet along the way. 
One of my passions is travel: I've been fortunate to Scuba dive in the Red Sea, Palau, & Fiji, ski at Whistler, Breckenridge and Mammoth, cruise the Baltic, Mediterranean and meet friends for sun & fun in Sydney, Capetown and Thailand.
